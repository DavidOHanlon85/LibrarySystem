<h1>Library System</h1>

The developer of the classes has suddenly left the company and has left no documentation. Your manager has reviewed the code and informed you of issues with code clarity, including a lack of comments and some possible defects. In addition not all the requirements have been implemented. It is your task to implement these, test the classes and raise the coding standards of the classes.
